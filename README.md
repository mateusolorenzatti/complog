# CompLog
Developed as a final paper for IT certificate.

CompLog is basically a way of practicing basic steps of programming logic using the library Blockly on an Android app. It sends the generated 'code' to a robot built with Arduino tools via MQTT to execute the described steps.

There is also an REST API where teachers are able to post challanges, and the app users are able to choose the challange by the difficulty level.
